        <h1>Week 8</h1>
           <h2>Reading</h2>
               <p>This week was the easiest to read and understand. I have done a lot already with CSS3 and HTML5. Matter of fact the reading material was used in my Advanced CSS class as well as my Web Media class. I have not mastered it all quite yet but I am always trying to improvise and learn new ways to make the Front End work to my advantage. WIth my other class I am learning more ways to use and implement CSS and HTML but using server side operations and functions to create the different pages that I use. For example, when I am done with the section, will be the reviews, but a current be the messages table. Albeit it is empty right now.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Since the last meeting I was able to finish my ToDo App. You can find that on Week 06. I used the "< iframe >" tag in order to get the app to show from its source. I was also able to get in with Team 1. They were able to help me figure out what needed to be done with Todo App. Although one thing that I didn’t fix was setting up the app to filter out blank submissions.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>Next week, with some luck, faith and hope, I will get through the readings, individual assignment and come up with a project idea that is within the scope of the requirements. Fortunately Team 1 is full of people that have been working on classes together for many semesters and are not that much older than me. Additionally they have experience in the industry and look to work well with each other. I can only hope to not be a burden during the semester.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>This week I really don’t think I had any blockers. I already know the material quite well, I hope that my experience has been evident in my work so far. I also had plenty of help from the new team and that alone made a HUGE difference in not having last week’s blockers. On another note I am getting some help with my ADHD and that has helped a lot. Now if I could just find a job or build up any of my business ideas to use my skills and work for myself then things would be golden.</p>
            <h2>Code Examples</h2>
                <p>My example is my original/current project that is my step-father's business site that I have been building. The base site is done with HTML, SCSS and a little JS. The other parts that manage the site is server side using PSQL.</p>
                <p>The examples of the transforms would be the trapezoids with the pictures and the SVGs would be the manufacturers as well as the logo and contact number.</p>
                <p>The project is housed on Heroku so the link is external.</p>
