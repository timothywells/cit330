        <h1>Week 6</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>This week there wasn’t any reading but I did review most of the book to try and fix some of the problems that I was running into while working on my To Do Application that was due this week.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Since last week I have been working on my project, I have been having a lot of trouble getting the filter buttons to work. Aside from that it has been just the project. Unfortunately I didn’t get finished and have to keep working on it.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>Next week is the end of the first half of the semester. Unfortunately I did not get the ToDo App done this week so I will be working on it next week. With any luck I will be able to do my normal weekly homework and finish the app.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>This week my blocker was the ToDo App filtering. I tried to do some things but I could never get it to work in time for this week, sorry.</p>
                <h2>To-Do application Project</h2>
                <p>I was able to get the app to work with the filtering but I still haven't figured out how to make it prevent you from submitting a blank . I am sure it is easy to fix but it was not a requirement and I am to far behind to bother with it. Sorry.</p>
