        <h1>Week 9</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>This week’s reading was in Chapter 9: The Window Object and Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs.</p>
                <p>The Window Object chapter, covers a number of different aspects that deals with the browser itself. Some of the things that you can do include getting browser information, browser history, controlling windows, cookies and general use of storage on the PC. All of these things work with in what is called the BOM or Browser Object Model. This is where things change up a little in the aspect of the BOM is really only something that works within the browser and is really not something that other environments have. One such environment is Node.js which is what I am trying to use in my other class. Also one of the things that I have seen that I wanted to use in my back end project is the pop up window. Which is something a lot of people use for sign ins but it is not necessary. All in all, BOM is a pretty commonly used part of a website, especially since HTML5 became the standard</p>
                <p>Speaking of HTML5 and moving on the HMTL5 API.s chapter, this is the one that was the most interesting because I plan on using an API in my project. However it is also one of the things that I am not super sure how to use. I know that I can use things like local storage, which according to the book is basically its own API. I used a lot of local storage elements for my ToDo app. However, one of the things that I found interesting is the data- attribute. I am not sure how I will use this in my project but I know it is something that I should use if I am getting information from the Google Books API. Something that I am probably not going to use in my project but we did use in the team activity is geolocation. Being able to determine latitude, longitude, speed, altitude, heading and set a timestamp are all important when grabbing information such as weather. The final part of the chapter is the most intriguing and will likely be the one most used in my further applications. This last section is about Web Workers and how they allow JavaScript, a single threaded language, the ability to run more than one script at a time. The way that this is done is by putting the process or function in it’s own js file then set a constant with that constant equaling new Worker() and in the parenthesis you would have the js file that needs to be called. This will be one of the best thing to use for my project because I will be using a search method to search the Google Book API and then showing the results on the screen to the user.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>What I have done is spend a lot of time catching up on my class work. I am a little bit behind but at least now I have an actual plan for my project. It is still going to take some wffort but since I have picked something that is well documented online as a common project for full stack developers. Which means I shouldn’t have too much trouble creating my final project.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>The next important thing to do is getting started on the actual final project. I need to start building the different parts starting with the design. Then stitch together the action that are needed and finally connect the API to it and troubleshoot everything that is left.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>My main blocker as usual is me. I am trying to understand everything but its proving difficult. I am trying to do better with my team but they have been working together for a while which makes it hard for me to learn anything. Mostly it makes it difficult because I ask for people to explain what they are doing and why. Unfortunately it is always the same, it annoys people. The other thing that I was having trouble with was the practice assignment. I installed the necessary package but for some reason I couldn’t get Parcel to work. I just kept getting an error. Then I switched over to my other computer and it seemed to work, sort of, I will have to redo that assignment after purging what I have and redownloading it again. So all in all I need to work harder and learn better, not relying on others since that looks to be failing me consistently.</p>
