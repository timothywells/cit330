        <h1>Week 7</h1>
        <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>This week the reading covered Further Functions and AJAX. Honestly the reading was interesting. First with the Further Functions, it showed me that there are way to take what we have learned and condense that code down so that instead of having repetitive code you can make it conditional. Ironically I used some of those further functions like setting constants that get items by ID and Class in my Todo App that I have been trying to finish. Another thing that I added that was similar is event listeners. Something that I have already used that is related to further functions is the try/catch but in my Back End Class so I am a little familiar with how it works. All in all the Further Functions chapter was interesting and hopefully will make the next project a little easier than the first app.</p>
            <p>Now as for AJAX, it’s a little difficult to understand but that is because it is just a little different than traditional JS. AJAX is used to communicate with a server much like NODE does. Which both do the same things in the aspect of communication with a server. As I read through the chapter I came to find out more about how AJAX helps traditional JavaScript to communicate with the server. From the video that I watched on it, not related to the book, it explained that JS is a front end language, SQL and other serverlanguages are the back end while AJAX and NODE are more a middle man that allows the front end and back end to communicate with each other. One of the many things they do is grab information from an API which stands for Application Programming Interface. An API, to my understanding, is a database of information that can be accessed using AJAX and NODE from a website. What I know is this, I will be using AJAX a bit more in my other class and but will likely use the same project for both classes with the difference being one will be deployed on the front end, this class, the other will be deployed on my server, the back end.</p>
        <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
            <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                <p>SInce the last meeting I have been mostly working on the ToDo App. I tried to do a simple AJAX Api for this week’s example since I have not been doing examples.</p>
            <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                <p>I plan on finishing my app next week now that I have a group to work with.</p>
            <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                <p>My team has disappeared. Chambers left for another group and didn’t say anything. Briana just stopped showing up for team meetings starting last week. So I have not had anyone to work with or get any help from. Not that they were any help to begin with.</p>
            <h2>Code Examples</h2>
                <p>I found a AJAX example that is setup to retireve some information from Wikipedia about a person. I put this same examplet to one of my heros. I have always admired Einstein and his genius. In highschool I created a class my senior year that revolved around the theoretical science of time travel. Granted we didn't cover Einstein indepth, we covered the science that is time travel that Stephen Hawking put out in his book "A Brief History of Time".</p>
