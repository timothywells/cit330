        <h1>Week 2</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>Going through the reading has been interesting. The material that is covered is something that I struggle with when it comes to implementation. One thing that I want to do but am still trying to figure out is how to shorten my code in my js file on the class site I am making. Which using arrays is the way I think would be the best fit. I was thinking that you can do nested arrays in a function but I think that is a little more advanced than I am capable of at the moment. Shoot, it may not even be possible using front end information. Since I am taking Back End II as well I may have to look into an alternate way to get information. Like I want to be able to make a new page each week and as soon as I add a page, not just adding to an existing page, I want the JS to add it to the navigation list and the link to the navigation in the browser. I think that this can be done using a combination of arrays, function, logic and loops. Again it is probably something more PHP related than JS related.</p>
                <p>As far as other things, I am still trying to find ways to use the JS I am re-learning. I have always had a terrible time actually coming up with everyday uses for javascript. I am hoping that I can be more effective at finding ways to use it other than simple things like navigation and changing some colors. I am just not as creative as so many other people that are in this and other classes. I am a straight forward thinker and if something doesn’t have an immediate use it is not useful to me, as my thought process goes. I guess I just need to change the way I think.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Not sure if the last meeting is the one on this past Wednesday or the one before. Either way most of what I have done is clean up things on the site. Making sure that each page has proper headers and the correct language setup. I have been trying to keep up with the reading since I am a bit behind on JS in general. Another thing that I changed is I put the CSS and JS in their own folders, albeit I am not sure that was totally necessary. Some other things that I changed include updating all the links, forcing the footer to stay on the bottom of the page per the screen as a minimum size and I added a copyright date.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>I looked at the future reading and one of the things that I want to do is part of that reading. I want to add today’s date into my page. I am not sure where I will put it but I know it is something that I want. The footer is feasible but at the same time I already have the copyright date.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>My blocker, again is me. I am not sure how to make the site better but I am wanting to find something that I can put on upcoming pages that show some skills with JS. The problem is coming up with something. I am not all that creative but when I am it is usually way out of the scope of the class, my ability and the available time that i have. Other blockers that I have to deal with all the time are my ADHD, my other class and of course the fact that I have a job. If I can get through this semester with a decent grade then I will be ecstatic. Until then I have to overcome my many problems.</p>
