        <h1>Week 3</h1>
           <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>The reading this week was interesting. Some parts I understood with the objects and events, but the problem I had was understanding the DOM. At least I was having some trouble with it before in the previous iteration of the course. I am not saying that I have a firm grasp of the material but I do have a better understanding. I feel like if I were to do a few examples I would definitely be better off. The problem is time. With a full time job and another course under my belt my time is limited. A bit more limited than I had expected but I should have expected. Full time work that is not Lyft or driving a school bus can be challenging. Not saying that I am not grateful, I am totally grateful, but the job is time wasting at this point. I just need to be patient.</p>
           <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Since last week’s meeting I have refined some of my site in general and tried to clean up my code so that it would be more like what would be done server side. Unfortunately that is not something that is normally done so I will have to leave that endeavour for my back end class. Other than that I have been doing a TON of reading. Ironically most of it has been the assigned reading. Which is quite a bit.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>I am planning on continuing by reading but also plan on adding a section to each of my week’s pages to include an exercise from each chapter because I understand the importance of having examples. My hope is that I can get some examples in this coming week and hopefully be more prepared for the upcoming projects. So far I have not been as productive as I had intended. I still intend on fixing all the file and repository names but it might have to wait until next weekend.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>h
                    <p>Again, as always, my blocker is me. I have a feeling that if I would get some sleep, get some help and stop stressing out I will be more productive. I feel like this class is just getting to me because it is a lot of information to take in. Which makes more than enough sense because it is a 300 level class.</p>
            <h2>Code Examples</h2>
                <p>COMING SOON</p>
