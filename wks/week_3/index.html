        <h1>Week 3</h1>
           <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>Notes</p>
           <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Since last week’s meeting I have refined some of my site in general and tried to clean up my code so that it would be more like what would be done server side. Unfortunately that is not something that is normally done so I will have to leave that endeavour for my back end class. Other than that I have been doing a TON of reading. Ironically most of it has been the assigned reading. Which is quite a bit.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>I am planning on continuing by reading but also plan on adding a section to each of my week’s pages to include an exercise from each chapter because I understand the importance of having examples. My hope is that I can get some examples in this coming week and hopefully be more prepared for the upcoming projects. So far I have not been as productive as I had intended. I still intend on fixing all the file and repository names but it might have to wait until next weekend.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>h
                    <p>Again, as always, my blocker is me. I have a feeling that if I would get some sleep, get some help and stop stressing out I will be more productive. I feel like this class is just getting to me because it is a lot of information to take in. Which makes more than enough sense because it is a 300 level class.</p>
            <h2>Code Examples</h2>
                <p>COMING SOON</p>
