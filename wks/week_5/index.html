        <h1>Week 5</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>This week wasn't particularly difficult in the reading. Mostly because I am kind of a master tester and debugger. I say that because at the moment I work as a Sofware Tester, albeit is testing video games, so there isn't any coding involved, just testing. However, being that I am doing other classes and am nearing the end of my schooling there are plenty of times that I have had to do testing. Just this weekend I spent several hours working with a different teammate in a different class to figure out what was missing in my database that could cause a table to not show. We eventually figured out that the issues was tow things, a semi-colon and a period. Funny how something so small can make such a big fuss. In the end though, the reading was quite informative and pointed out a few things that I forgot about.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>This past week I spent a lot of my time catching up in the reading because I am a bit behind. I still have not done as many exercises as I had wished to do in order to be more proficient in the coding environment but at least I have a better understanding of JS. Although I do feel like I need a lot more practice than what I have done so far.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>This next week I will be working on the To-Do assignment, which combines all the things that I have learned so far. Although it may not be super easy, I feel that it will be far easier than the projects on my Back End Dev II class have me working on but I will be able to take some of the concepts from that class and apply them to this class. Mostly that would be dealing with the storing of variables such as the information in each task as well as adding and deleting tasks. All of which is great for local stroage but at the same time isn't that great because if you clear out your browser history there goes all your data. What is important is getting right because if I get it right I will be able to then use it with a database.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>This past week Back End Dev II was the culprit for my being behind. However, Prime Day was this past week as well. Which means I finally got my hands on a Amazon Fire tablet. I have been wanting one for years but have never had the money to get one until now. The reason that I wanted one is to put my textbooks on, which is exactly what I did the moment I got it. I added the book from Sitepoint that we are studying from and that helped me read through it quickly and get caught up with everything. I sort of figured that by putting the book on a tablet that I would be able to more easily read the text and I was right. Hopefully this tool will help me through out the rest of the semester.</p>
            <h2>Code Examples</h2>
                <h4>Testing and Debugging</h4>
                    <p>This week there really wasn't any examples to show since it was more about learning and using debugging tools.</p>
