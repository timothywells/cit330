        <h1>Week 10</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>This week the reading covered Validating Forms and Using Fetch from the Mozilla Development Network site.</p>
                <p>The first part is one that I am familiar with, using in form validation. This is one of the things that I love the most about forms in HTML. Most of the time validation is done either through JavaScript or done on the server but by putting the <b>required</b> you donâ€™t necessarily have to write a portion of code that tells the user that the field is required. You do still need to clean the input to prevent injection hacks, which are lines of code being sent to the server, if you have a server. However, using just the required portion is only one step of many that can be used for form validation on the client side. Ideally you would have a JavaScript function run other portions of validation such as setting up the allowable or required length. The validity of the entered information such as making sure that an email is entered, which requires the @ symbol and ending in a DOT domain. Other portions of validation that can be used that I will be using in my project include verifying information against an API. In my project I will be doing a search function that will search the Google Book API. This search field will need to contact the API to validate the information of the search against what is in the API then return the results to the user. At least that is the understanding that I am getting from that portion of validation against an API. Further research is needed.</p>
                <p>The next area that is covered is <b>fetch()</b> which essentially does as the function says it fetches information that can be used by other portions of the site. One of the examples given is <b>Service Workers</b> which was covered last week. Again relating to my project the <b>fetch()</b> function can be used to get an API and all the information that it contains so that it can be used in an application or website. This is one of the essential things that I will be doing with my project. As far as the MDN page on <b>fetch()</b> there is even more information on the use of <b>fetch()</b> with other functions such as requests and responses. Again further research is needed.</p>
        <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
           <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
               <p>Since the last meeting I have been trying to finalize my designs for my second project. The problem that I have been dealing with is being able to use this project with my other class as well.</p>
           <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
               <p>I am planning on starting on my project this coming coming week. I was fortunate enough to be able to take all of Thanksgiving and Black Friday off so I have a lot of time to work on it.</p>
           <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
               <p>The blocker that I have is still me. I am trying to be productive and keep up on my tasks but I always let my own mind mess with myproductivity. Now that I have gotten some help with my ADHD, which makes things a little easier but I am still needing to work on not getting distracted or overthinking everything like I normally do.</p>
       <h2>Code Examples</h2>
           <p>Here is my repository and an example. Which again is Talon Air because I used required on the forms and did some validation but not local validation. That is one thing that I plan on doing for comparing passwords when registering.</p>
