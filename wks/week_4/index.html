        <h1>Week 4</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>This week the reading covered Forms, OOP and Modern JavaScript. When it comes to th reading it was interesting because I understand Forms quite well but I struggle with OOP and “Modern JavaScript” is something new. Some things in the text I know about like jQuery and libraries but some of the new things that were not covered in other classes are modularity and WebPack. I wanted to know more about modularity a few weeks ago and the reading this week opened my mind to it a bit more. On another topic in the very same chapter was optimization of code with minification. Another subject that I wanted to know more about because it is important to be able to optimize the code so that the browser that the user has opened, the site that is opened will not take a significant amount of time to load. Which part of the loading time has to deal with the amount of information that is being loaded. So with optimization you are loading the same amount of information but with less code. All in all the reading this week was eye opening but I wonder if the other chapters would have been just as important. Reason being is that as mentioned in the class meeting jQuery did not go the direction that people expected and is not used in the industry nearly as often. However, I see a lot of AJAX jobs out there. I even have seen other languages that are needed such as COBOL and that has been thought as a language not used that often. Life of a coding language and library is strange.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Since last week I have spent a lot of time reading but unfortunately not as much time using what I have learned. The reading has been great because it is very informative. It is just difficult to do the reading because I get easily distracted.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>My site is still the same as usual but I plan on making some improvements with the modularity I learned. Mostly with setting up and keeping my practice projects in the specific sections I have setup at the bottom of each week’s page.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>This week my blocker has been my other class and myself. I have been letting my studies stress me out so much that I cannot function or imagine working on anything while I focus on the other class. Because of this I feel a little behind in both classes and am going to need to find a more effective way to balance my day between work, school and sleep in order to catch up.</p>
