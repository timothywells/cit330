            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>The reading this week was interesting. Some parts I understood with the objects and events, but the problem I had was understanding the DOM. At least I was having some trouble with it before in the previous iteration of the course. I am not saying that I have a firm grasp of the material but I do have a better understanding. I feel like if I were to do a few examples I would definitely be better off. The problem is time. With a full time job and another course under my belt my time is limited. A bit more limited than I had expected but I should have expected. Full time work that is not Lyft or driving a school bus can be challenging. Not saying that I am not grateful, I am totally grateful, but the job is time wasting at this point. I just need to be patient.</p>
