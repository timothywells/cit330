        <h1>Week 1</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>This week has been interesting. Mostly becuase I have been crash coursing everything in JavaScript that I am not familiar with. One thing that I am good at, though, is I can read code and then modify it to my use. I had to do a lot of research on setting up the JS for the Dynmaic JS Navigation. It is not exactly what I want for my site but at the very least it gets me closer to my end goal of making a site entirely my own without using any other builder or code that I did not develop. This semester will be very intersting but also stressful beyond belief AND it is my last one, hopefully.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Well, since the meeting on Wednesday I have been hammering away at the readings online and the few books that I have from the other CIT classes I have taken. I have a lot to catch up on since I never caught on in the beginning. Shoot the dynamic navigation bar has been my bane for the past four years. When I took the course in January as CIT 261 it was so open ended that I would ask questions to the teacher and he would say, politley, go and figure it out and let me know what you found. At least you had an example and I could search github for other people's examples. So NOW I know how to do a dynamic navigation bar.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>I am going to continue reading through the material. Ironically it is hard to read at the moment. My meaning is that after not having to read a ton I have slowed down significantly in my reading. As far as things for the site, I plan on fixing it up with some flexbox to work dynamically with the JS so that the side navigation works more dynamically. Basically I am trying to setup side navigation so that when I start doing my blog more I can have endless scroll with dates by year, month, day then title on the right that drop down. So instead of doing a different page it all  is on one page and just opens the article in the main body.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>My blockers are me. I get overly frustrated when I work on project and as such my temper flares and that leads to me stressing out. Which all that leads to me just turning on music and laying down until I have calmed down. I used to just go out for a ride on my motorcycle but I had to sell it because of so many things. Mostly not having a place of my own. All in all it is not my learning capabilities that get me or the ADHD, which is a problem, but just the motivation. The willingness to work on something that requires my attention AND requires that I figure it out. Not that it is hard but it is hard. It's all hard to explain (^_^). I can usually do things quickly and time crunches do give the best results from me but I am trying to do things early on in the week. Also I hope I picked a good team to be with this time. When I was in your class years ago my team all jetted and I was left with one other person who was milking it. Anyways I think that is it for now.</p>
