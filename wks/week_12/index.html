        <h1>Week 12</h1>
            <h2>Reading</h2>
                <p>There wasn't any reading this week so nothing there to report.</p>
            <h2>Weekly Report</h2>
                <h4>What did I do since the last meeting?</h4>
                    <p>Since the last meeting I spent a lot of time on the design of the app itself. I did some research into how I would actually get the API together but am a little apprehensive in getting started, at least when it comes to writing the actual code for the JavaScript.</p>
                <h4>What am I going to do next?</h4>
                    <p>My plan between now and the end of the semester is to just meet the requirements of the class. I spend to much time working on the small things that sometimes I don't get the big stuff done.</p>
                <h4>What are my blockers?</h4>
                    <p>As for blockers, really the bigest thing for me is understanding how the code works together in such a way that, well in short, works. I feel like that one AHA! moment has not happened quite yet. With any lick things will work out before the end of the semester. </p>
