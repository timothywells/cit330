        <h1>Week 14</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>You will find all the necessary information in regards to my Book Finder App.</p>
            <p>You can find the repository on <a href="https://github.com/timothywells/cit330/tree/master/wks/Project_2/myApp">GitHub</a></p>

        <h2>YouTube Presentation</h2>
            <p>Have a look at my video presentation. Its a little longer than expected:</p>

        <h2>Book Finder App</h2>
            <p>Below you will find an iframe of my app if you wish to play with it instead of going to my Project Two page or did't hit the Book Finder link above . Just wanted to point out as well that I didn't mention the for loop that I did find that I could use. It is called the for...in loop. So indstead of declaring variables and doing the i++ all you have to do is this: for(i in array). Thie one little thing does exactly the same thing as the normal for loop but simplifies a little. The catch is that it is specifically designed to be used with objects and not strings. Once I had that in place it literally fixed a huge error block. The other thing that I did was put inline try/catch to stop errors from being sent out but isntead it would return something so that the process of listing the bookcards wasn't interupted.</p>
