            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                This is my GitHub hosted website for Front End Web Development II. This class has by far been one of the hardest for me. That is mostly due 
                to the fact that it is a very open class that gives you plenty of time to do the work. However, due to the lack of structure and my personal 
                inability to focus on the subject at hand it has, was and will be one of the hardest classes that I have ever experienced. That being said feel
                free to go through my site with a grain of salt. I am not a perfect coder and am by far not a perfect human being but I did give it by best shot
                despite my fallings.

                As a final note don't let my brief explanation and experience discourage you. The class is actually very important, I have found that out recently 
                because I started a job as a Quality Assurance Tester and you literally have to train yourself. Albeit isn't easy it is interesting. Lastly, make yourself a schedule 
                if you don't do this you will find that you painted yourself into a corner and the house is on fire. Give yourself time, do the work and make lists so you can check things off as you do them.
